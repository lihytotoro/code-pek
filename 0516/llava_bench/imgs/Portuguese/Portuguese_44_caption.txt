A watercolor painting of three animals picnicking around a table made of a tree stump. On the left, a brown bear is eating a chocolate cookie; in the middle, a blue-grey cat is holding a blue mug, and on the right, a light-brown rabbit is sipping from a pink coffee mug. On the table, there is a plate with various kinds of cookies. They are surrounded by grass, and tree leaves are visible above the rabbit.
