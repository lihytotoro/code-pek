A meme featuring two distinct parts. In the top half, it says "statistical learning," and there is a person standing in front of a whiteboard with a concerned expression. A plot showing a red curve gradually decreasing is displayed, and the chat bubble reads: "People, our learner overgeneralizes because the VC-Dimension of our Kernel is too high. Get some experts and minimize the structural risk in a new one. Rework our loss function, make the next kernel stable, unbiased, and consider using a soft margin." In the bottom half of the image, it says "neural networks," and there is another person standing in front of a whiteboard with a happy expression. A plot showing a green curve with both x and y axes labeled "LAYERS" is displayed. The big chat bubble reads: "STACK MORE LAYERS." At the bottom of the meme, it reads: "But unironically."
