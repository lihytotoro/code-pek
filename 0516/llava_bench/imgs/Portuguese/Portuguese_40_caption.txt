A meme with three panels: one panel on the left and two stacked panels on the right. Panel 1: A smartphone (resembling an iPhone) with a VGA cable plugged into its charging port. The VGA cable is white, and the VGA connector is blue. The phone is protected with a glass screen protector and a protective case. Panel 2: A product package containing a VGA connector that closely resembles the one shown in the first panel. The brand is ELECOM, specifically the P-APLTDCN series. At the bottom, there is a green sticker that reads: "For Lightning Cable." Panel 3: A top view of the connector, similar to the previous panels. The actual connector is visible only in this panel, and it shows that it is actually a Lightning connector.
