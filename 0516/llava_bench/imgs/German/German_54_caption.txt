An advertisement from Subway with a black background. On the top left, there is the Subway logo (SUBWAY SERIES), and the slogan reads "A NEW WAY TO SUBWAY." There are two sandwiches in the photo, possibly a footlong sandwich cut in half. The sandwiches are served with toasted bread (possibly artisan Italian bread), cheese, ham, salami, shredded lettuce, tomato, and banana peppers.
